        <h2>Transit Advocacy and Safety</h2>

        <img class="stickers" src="stickers/car.png" alt="icon of car" />
        <h3>Car</h3>
        <p>
        Cars are a staple of modern transportation, but they come with
          significant drawbacks. They contribute to traffic congestion,
          pollution, and urban sprawl.
        </p>

        <img class="stickers" src="stickers/bicycle.png" alt="icon of bike" />
        <h3>Bicycle</h3>
        <p>
          Bicycles offer a sustainable and healthy alternative to cars. They
          reduce carbon emissions, promote physical activity, and require less
          space for parking.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <img class="stickers" src="stickers/walk.png" alt="icon of person walking" />     
        <h3>Walking</h3>       
        <p>
          Walking is the most basic form of transportation and has numerous
          health benefits. It is also environmentally friendly and helps to
          reduce traffic congestion.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <img class="stickers" src="stickers/bus.png" alt="icon of bus" />       
        <h3>Bus</h3>        
        <p>
          Buses are a cost-effective way to move large numbers of people. They
          can help reduce the number of cars on the road, leading to less
          traffic and lower emissions.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <img class="stickers" src="stickers/tram.png" alt="icon of tram" /> 
        <h3>Tram</h3>       
        <p>
          Trams are an efficient and reliable mode of urban transportation.
          They can carry a large number of passengers (more than buses) and
          help reduce the reliance on cars.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <img class="stickers" src="stickers/metro.png" alt="icon of metro-rail" />        
        <h3>Metro-rail</h3>       
        <p>
          Metro-rail systems are essential for high-density urban areas. They
          provide fast and efficient transportation, reducing travel time and
          easing road congestion.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <img class="stickers" src="stickers/train.png" alt="icon of train" />   
        <h3>Train</h3>  
        <p>
          Trains are a vital part of long-distance travel and freight
          transport. They are more energy-efficient than cars and planes,
          making them a greener option for intercity travel.

          <h2>Did you know?</h2>
          <p>
            The average car is parked 95% of the time. This means that cars are
            often underutilized, taking up valuable space in urban areas that
            could be used for other purposes, such as parks, bike lanes, or
            pedestrian walkways.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite a normal car being able to carry 5 people, the average
            ridership rate is only 1.33 people per car. This means that most cars
            on the road are carrying only one person, leading to inefficient use
            of road space and increased traffic congestion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. have increased by 50% from 2009 to
            2018, highlighting the dangers of car-centric infrastructure and its
            lack of scalability.

        <h2 id="advocacy">Transit Advocacy</h2>
        <p>
          Transit advocacy is the practice of promoting and supporting public
          transportation systems to improve urban mobility, reduce traffic
          congestion, and enhance the overall quality of life in cities. It
          involves various activities, including lobbying for better funding,
          raising awareness about the benefits of public transit, and
          encouraging community involvement in transportation planning.
        </p>

        <h3 id="pre_war">Pre-war Urbanism</h2>
        <p>
          Pre-war urbanism refers to the design and development of cities before
          World War II. During this period, cities were often characterized by
          mixed-use neighborhoods, walkable streets, and a strong emphasis on
          public transportation. The layout of these cities promoted social
          interaction and community engagement, with amenities such as parks,
          schools, and shops located within walking distance of residential
          areas.

        <h3 id="modern">Modern Urbanism in North America</h2>
        <p>
          Modern urbanism, which emerged after World War II, is often marked by
          car-centric development patterns. This era saw the rise of suburban
          sprawl, with large residential areas separated from commercial and
          industrial zones. The focus on automobile transportation led to wider
          roads, increased parking spaces, and a decline in public transit use.
          This shift has had significant implications for urban sustainability,
          social equity, and overall quality of life.
        </p>

        <h3 id="modern">Modern Urbanism in Europe</h2>
        <p>
          In contrast to North America, many European cities have maintained a
          focus on public transportation and walkability in their urban design.
          European urbanism often features dense, mixed-use neighborhoods with
          extensive public transit networks, including buses, trams, and metro
          systems. This approach has helped to reduce car dependency, promote
          sustainable transportation options, and enhance the overall livability
          of cities.
        </p>

        <h2 id="dangers">Dangers of Car-Centric Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>
          Car-centric infrastructure poses several dangers to urban
          environments. It contributes to increased traffic congestion, air
          pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. The emphasis on cars often
          leads to the neglect of pedestrian and cyclist safety, resulting in
          higher rates of accidents and fatalities. Additionally, car-centric
          development can exacerbate social inequalities by limiting access to
          transportation for those who cannot afford a car or are unable to
          drive.
